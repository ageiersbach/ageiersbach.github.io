This project was my first official Rails app, which I started in 2013 under the
mentorship of [Christoph Witzany](https://github.com/webcrofting). It was built
to be a little more advanced than the typical "TODO MVC" app--providing the user
with the ability to form fully customizable lists. Over the years, I
have returned many times to this app. I have found it useful when I was first
practicing test-driven development (TDD), when I wanted to experiment with es6
on a working Rails app, when I was learning how to configure my work app for
continuous integration, and when I wanted to work through some of the pain points
of upgrading Rails itself on a smaller application than my employer's.
