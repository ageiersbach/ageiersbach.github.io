I created this library to learn Rust and play with strings--hence the name.
Incidentally, I played the viola when I was younger. This string instrument
does not make music, but it might as well do that, given how enjoyable rust is
to work with. I now have some sympathy for those people who show up in every
comment thread to ask, "Have you considered rewriting this in Rust?"
