TODO
I should have a more detailed description of what I did here!
- what was it like working with Phoenix/Elixir?
- what did I find difficult?
- why did I stop working on it?
- the original idea
{% endcomment %}

I created this application to learn Phoenix/Elixir. I was mostly interested in
learning how web sockets worked in the platform, since this was before Rails had
anything like it.

The original purpose of this was to create a livereload rspec test reporter with
websockets (I was inspired by [this post](https://blog.jcoglan.com/2013/07/01/running-rspec-tests-from-the-browser/)).
