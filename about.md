I do most of my work as a web developer with Ruby and Javascript; but when I get a chance, I explore other languages and frameworks.

Some of my current projects are:

- [Collisterator](github.com/webcrofting/collisterator) (Ruby/Rails) : a self-hosted list-making tool
- [Inferno](github.com/ageiersbach/inferno) (Elixir/Phoenix) : a test runner
- [RomanDate](github.com/ageiersbach/romandate) (Erlang) : a Roman date conversion tool
- [WookieBookie](github.com/ageiersbach/wookiebookie) (Ruby/Rails) : a wookie racing game

These are all in various stages of in progress. :)
